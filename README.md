# Rails' Capstone Project

> In this project I build a web app called 'BarHops' where the user can count how many times has visited a certain bar and then group them by categories or 'groups'.
Also, I followed the given design which is [Snapscan](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19759151/Snapscan-iOs-design-and-branding?tracking_source=) and I changed the content.

The main objective was to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the app following business requirements.

Here is the user journey for the app:
1. The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username.
2. The user is presented with a profile page that includes links to:
  * "All my transactions".
  * "All my external transactions".
  * "All groups".
3. When the user opens "All my transactions" page:
  * Total amount is displayed at the top.
  * A list of all transactions created by the logged-in user is displayed (sorted by most recent).
  * Each transaction displays its name, amount and date, and an icon of the group it belongs to.
  * An action button "Add new" is displayed.
4. When the user opens "All my external transactions" page (see the *Transactions list page* screenshot above):
  * A list of all transactions that are created by a logged-in user but **not assigned to any group** (sorted by most recent).
  * The design of the page is similar to the "All my transactions".
5. When the user opens "All groups" page:
  * A list of all groups is displayed (example ideas for names: "Kitchen renovation", "Books, music & culture", "Car maintenance") in alphabetical order.
  * Each group displays its icon, name, and creation date.
  * Each group is clickable and opens the "Group transactions" page.
  * An action button "Create new" is displayed.
  * The design of the page is similar to the "User profile page"
6. When the user opens the "Group transactions" page:
  * A list of all transactions that belong to that group is displayed.
  * The design of the page is similar to the "All my transactions". Besides the information that appears in All my transactions page, each transaction displays the **name of the author** of the transaction.
7. When the user opens "Create new group" or "Add new transaction" page:
  * A form with all necessary fields is displayed.
  * It's not in the given design, but you should make an effort to follow the same style of the other pages.
